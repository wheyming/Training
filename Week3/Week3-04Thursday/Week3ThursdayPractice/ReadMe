1.)	Write a program using delegates and events: 
-	A counter class which increases the counter every 5 seconds. 
-	Every 20 counts it raises an event which is subscribed by the main class. 
-	The main class on receiving the event prints “event received”.

2.)	Write a program with the following specifications: 
-	A main class which subscribes to an event called “Alert”.
-	On receiving an alert it can notify the users with a text output.
-	A class called Earthquake which captures the intensity of the earthquake and the place of occurrence.
-	Additionally we have another class called Tsunami which has one member probability of tsunami.
-	Once you create an earthquake object you have to pass the “Place” and intensity information to the class.
-	The earthquake class then creates a Tsunami object and calls the member “CalculateTsunamiProbability”.
-	The probability of a Tsunami is calculated by the formula “P(T) = I(E)*0.7+ 0.3 * RandomOccuranceChance” I(E) – Denotes the intensity of an earthquake.
-	The Tsunami Class will notify it’s subscribers regarding the probability of a Tsunami. The main class will display it.

3.)	Write a program for random encryption key generator
-	 The program will take few inputs from a user (characters to be used for generating a random key, public key for which an encryption key will be generated, Time difference          within which a key should be generated)
-	 The generator class has a member called Public key which has to bootstrapped during object creation.
-	 The generator class keeps track of each of the random string generated and can return it if needed by an exposed indexer.
-	 The generator class have additional method called "Start" and "Stop" which starts and stops generating keys
-	 The main class can create an object of generator class and then can start or stop depending on its need.
-	 It can subscribe to an event exposed by generator class to display all the encryption keys sent by the generator. 

4.)	create a hotel mgmt. system to perform different operation given below. First you must book a room according to your convenience. then you will choose the services you want    then a bill will generate with all the details and with tax

5.)	create a hospital mgmt. system to enrol a patient according to his condition, ex. emergency, outpatient department, clinical services etc. then after the inspection the doctor will send  him to pharmacy to collect the medicine . and at last, you need to generate a bill with all the patient details

6.)	create a blood bank to collect blood units of different blood groups. you will supply this blood to all the needy people , at a time you can only store 50 units of blood. if your stock goes down below 5 units it shows a warning message to collect urgently . take a track of supply units of different blood groups

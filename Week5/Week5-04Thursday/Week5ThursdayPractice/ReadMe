1.)	I want to design a banking system here we perform different banking system operations. But all the operations have to be operated by different persons. And these operators are to be assigned by the manager every day. you must go to the bank continuously for one week to execute these following operations 1. APPLAY FOR A LOAN  2. DOCUMENT VERIFICATION 3. NEGOTIATING THE LOAN DETAILS 4. FINAL APPROVAL AND DEPOSIT  5. WITHDRAWAL OF                                   
Now show me the operations and their operator details of the bank for one week.
